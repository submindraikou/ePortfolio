# About me

Hello! My name is Thomas Avila. I served as a Sophomore Advisor for the LechFadden Honors community during the 2020-2021 academic year and a Junior Advisor during the 2021-2022 academic year. Currently I am nothing.

My hobbies are all computer-related, specifically video games and programming, and as I complete projects I'll occasionally upload them to my GitHub account or mention it here if it's a noteworthy project.
