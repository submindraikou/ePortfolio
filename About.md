# About me

Hello! My name is Thomas Avila.

I am a general engineering student at Texas A&M with plans to go into computer science. As you may notice this ePortfolio is somewhat empty but I plan on changing this during my time at A&M.

My hobbies are all computer-related, specifically video games and programming, and as I complete projects I'll occasionally upload them to my GitHub account or even mention it here if it's a noteworthy project.
