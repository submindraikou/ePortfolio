# About me

Hello! My name is Thomas Avila.

I am a general engineering student at Texas A&M with plans to go into computer science. As you may notice this ePortfolio is somewhat empty but I plan on changing this during my time at A&M.

My hobbies are all computer-related, specifically video games and programming, and as I complete projects I'll occasionally upload them to my GitHub account or even mention it here if it's a noteworthy project.

#### Research interests
A broad field related to my annotated bibliography topic, which was about digital censorship and its real-world effects, is the application of artificial intelligence in language processing. The development of robots that have a greater grasp on communication is a topic that interests me because an AI with good linguistic skills can improve robotic tech support, act as an advanced content filter for family-friendly websites, or simply improve human interaction with technology.
