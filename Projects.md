## A compilation of my projects.

## Chicken Splat
#### A project from when I was bored. Looking back I am pleasantly suprised at what my younger self managed to accomplish.

## Watch Grass Grow
#### Another bored project a few years after Chicken Splat that somehow features even less gameplay and more advanced code.
#### Running this "game" requires Node.js. From what I remember, after going into the download directory with the cd command, you only need to run the command "node index.js" to start the local server. If this doesn't work you can try "npm install" to install needed packages (although I don't think I have any dependancies for this).

## This
#### I believe that technically this ePortfolio counts as a project. If not here then perhaps in some alternate universe.
