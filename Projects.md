## A compilation of my projects.

## Chicken Splat
#### A project from when I was bored. Looking back I am pleasantly suprised at what my younger self managed to accomplish.

## Watch Grass Grow
#### Another bored project a few years after Chicken Splat that somehow features even less gameplay and more code.
#### Running this "game" requires Node.js. From what I remember, after going into the download directory with the cd command, you only need to run the command "node index.js" to start the local server.
